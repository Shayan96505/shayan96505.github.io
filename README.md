## First and foremost, I'm a Jr. Java| Android engineer, world-traveller, and environmentalist.

I am a quick learner, that never quits. I am currently attending the Deep Dive Coding 
Java + Android Bootcamp. I'm in the process of designing an app that nudges people to text back their contacts, to promote friendships and better texting between acquaintances, which may blossom into friendships.

In addition to that, in my capstone team, I'm leading the design of a photo-sharing platform, that fills in a niche role not currently being taken care of by the market. 
Upon completion of the bootcamp I will be searching for full-time employment in Java development | Android app development.
    
## Current projects

* [Keep In Touch](https://shayan-golafshani.github.io/keep-in-touch/)

	* A real simple, and clean app that nudges you text people back after a certain set period of time. It ensures that missed connections don't remain missed communications and it's goal is to deliver a sleek, and polished platform to create engagement, communication, and eventually community for teens, millenials, parents, and grandparent user types.

* [PicMe Gallery](https://picme-gallery.github.io/)

	* A simple, but powerful photo-sharing app that allows you access to a shared online gallery that is private between you and all the people you allow into your event. By using this app, you can bypass the steps of uploading and sharing through third parties like Facebook. This solves the basic problem, of having great photos of others, but no way to share them and only having grainy selfies of yourself. In PicMe we allow users to swap these photos easily in a shared _event_ gallery.

* [Hello World: Android app](https://github.com/Shayan96505/android-hello-world)

### Recently updated repositories

## Areas of interest in software engineering

I am deeply interested in the intersectionality of software, education, and sustainability. I got into designing apps and learning about software engineering so that I can eventually create solutions that change human behaviours. So that we can reduce our carbon emissions and live on a more harmonius and greener planet. That said, I think that AI will be pivotal to accomploshing these goals in the future, so I hope to continue my education part-time while gaining practical software engineering skills in the field.
